## Roadmap for Development

### Step 1: Requirement Analysis
- **Objective**: Understand the project requirements and user needs.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Define key features like predictive analytics, dashboard, alerts, and reporting.
  2. Gather historical energy consumption data for model training.
  3. Identify target users (households, businesses, etc.).

### Step 2: Technology Stack Selection
- **Frontend**: React.js for building a responsive and dynamic user interface.
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js for server-side logic.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing user data and energy consumption records.
- **Machine Learning**: Python with libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow for developing predictive models.
- **API Integration**: REST APIs for communication between frontend, backend, and ML models.

### Step 3: Environment Setup
- **Frontend**:
  1. Install Node.js and npm.
  2. Create a React.js project using `npx create-next-app@latest` with NextJs Framework.
  3. Set up Material-UI or Tailwind CSS for styling.

- **Backend**:
  1. Initialize a Node.js project using `npm init`.
  2. Install required packages: Express, Mongoose, and dotenv.

- **Machine Learning**:
  1. Install Python and set up a virtual environment.
  2. Install required libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Flask.

- **Database**:
  1. Set up MongoDB Atlas or a local MongoDB server.
  2. Create collections for user data, energy consumption records, and predictions.

### Step 4: Data Preparation
- **Objective**: Preprocess and clean historical energy data for model training.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Collect data from sources like smart meters, public datasets, or user submissions.
  2. Clean and preprocess the data (handle missing values, normalize features).
  3. Split data into training and testing sets.

### Step 5: Machine Learning Model Development
- **Objective**: Build and train a model for energy consumption forecasting.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Use time series analysis techniques (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM).
  2. Train the model on historical data.
  3. Validate the model and tune hyperparameters for accuracy.
  4. Save the trained model using joblib or TensorFlow SavedModel.

### Step 6: Backend Development
- **Objective**: Build the API layer to handle data storage and ML model integration.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Set up routes for user authentication, data submission, and predictions.
  2. Integrate the ML model using Flask APIs or a direct Python integration.
  3. Test API endpoints using tools like Postman.

### Step 7: Frontend Development
- **Objective**: Create a user-friendly interface for visualization and interaction.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Design components for dashboards, charts, and settings using React.js.
  2. Use Chart.js or D3.js for data visualization.
  3. Integrate frontend with backend APIs.

### Step 8: Testing
- **Objective**: Ensure the application is bug-free and performs well.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Unit testing for frontend, backend, and ML model components.
  2. Integration testing to ensure seamless communication between modules.
  3. Load testing for performance under heavy usage.

### Step 9: Deployment
- **Objective**: Deploy the application for user access.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Host the backend on platforms like Heroku or AWS.
  2. Deploy the frontend on Netlify or Vercel.
  3. Use MongoDB Atlas for the database.

### Step 10: Maintenance and Updates
- **Objective**: Continuously improve and maintain the application.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Monitor user feedback and usage analytics.
  2. Add new features based on user demand.
  3. Update ML models with new data.
